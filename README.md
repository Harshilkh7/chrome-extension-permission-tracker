#  🔐 Real-Time Web Permission Tracker

##  🧩 Problem Statement

Modern web applications often require access to sensitive user permissions such as 📍location, 🎥camera, and 🎙️microphone. However, users lack transparency and control over which permissions are being accessed in real-time, leading to 🛑 privacy concerns and potential misuse. There is a need for a system that can track, display, and manage web permissions in real-time, empowering users with better control and awareness.

##  💡 Approach and Solution

Our solution is a **Real-Time Web Permission Tracker** powered by a 🧩 Chrome Extension and a 📊 live web dashboard. It monitors and visualizes web permission usage events, providing users with full transparency and insight.

### ⚙️ How it Works:

-  🧩 **Chrome Extension Integration:** The extension detects permission-related API calls (e.g., `navigator.geolocation`, `getUserMedia`, `Notification.requestPermission`) as they happen. Every request, grant, or deny event is captured immediately.

- 📝 **Live Event Logging:** Captured events are sent to a backend server and recorded along with metadata like site origin, permission type, timestamp, and action taken.

-  📊 **Live Visualization:** A React dashboard displays a real-time feed and historical timeline of all permission events. Users can:
    - View which sites requested camera, mic, or location access.
    - See when and how often permissions were used.
 

-  🧠 **User Awareness Panel:**
      - From either the extension popup or the dashboard, users can quickly **whitelist** permissions for specific sites.
      - Users are also guided to browser settings for stricter permission blocks if needed.

-  🛡️ **Compliance-Ready Logging:** All permission consent events are persistently stored, making the system useful for auditing and data protection regulations like **GDPR**, which require logs of informed user consent.

## ✨ Features

-  🔍 **Real-Time Monitoring:** Instantly tracks and displays permission requests as they happen.
-  📊 **User Dashboard:** Centralized interface to view and analyze all web permissions.
-  📡 **Permission Awareness:** Understand which sites are using what permissions.
-  🔔 **Notifications:** Real-time alerts when sensitive permissions are accessed.
-  🕓 **History Logs:** View historical data of permission usage for auditing.
-  🔒 **Secure & Privacy-Focused:** All data is handled securely, prioritizing user privacy.
